**Modernized and restored for 2026 site changes.** This extension helps you print your D&D Beyond character sheets in a clean, it was forked from the abandoned project by user "Adam Pritchard" on GitHub. I made this project because I wanted print-ready character sheets for my D&D games. without having to manually edit the PDF.


# Features

1. Drag & Drop sections to reorder them.
2. Resizable sections.
3. **WIP**: Clone sections, specifically for the SPELL section as I wanted to have all "purpose" spells on the same page with a header (like: "Spells for negtiation", "Spells for cave-combat", "Spells for dark encounter", etc.).

**This project is a work in progress. Feature requests and pull requests are welcome.**
