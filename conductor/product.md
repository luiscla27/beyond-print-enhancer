# Product Definition

## Initial Concept
D&D Beyond Players printing character sheets (Modernized for 2026)

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** D&D Beyond users (players and DMs) who prefer physical character sheets during gameplay.
- **Secondary:** Users who want a cleaner, distraction-free digital view of their character sheet without site navigation and ads.

## Core Value Proposition
The D&D Beyond Print Enhancer transforms the interactive, tabbed D&D Beyond character sheet into a condensed, printer-friendly format. It solves the problem of "hidden" content in tabs (Actions, Spells, Equipment) by expanding them into a single view and removing unnecessary web UI elements (nav bars, buttons, excessive padding) to optimize for physical paper printing.

## Key Features
- **Content Expansion:** Automatically expands and appends 'Actions', 'Spells', and 'Equipment' sections to the main view, eliminating the need to print multiple views or switch tabs.
- **Layout Optimization:** Removes site headers, navigation bars, sidebars, and interactive buttons (e.g., Short/Long Rest, Manage Spells) to maximize printable space.
- **Persistent Layout Management:** Provides a floating control panel to save custom section arrangements (coordinates, sizes, and internal scaling) to the browser (IndexedDB) or as local JSON files for portability.
- **Data Consolidation:** Relocates defense information (resistances, immunities) from hidden modals directly onto the combat tablet for immediate visibility.
- **Print Styling:** Adjusts text colors to black for better contrast and legibility on paper, and tightens margins/padding to fit more content per page.
